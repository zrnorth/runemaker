# Runemaker / Rolemaker

This is a cool little lib to help you find optimal champions for your favorite role,
and optimal runepages for your favorite champions.

Make sure you have pip and python3 installed first.

You need to get a riot api key and a championgg api key for the tool to work.

* Riot: https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/api-keys
* Champion.gg: http://api.champion.gg/

Enter these into lib/config. Then run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The page should appear at localhost:5000.
